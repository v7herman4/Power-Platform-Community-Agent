The Power Platform Community Agent

## Overview
The Power Platform Community Agent enables Center of Excellence and governance teams to scale support with intelligent responses to users in the community in a collaborating Microsoft Teams channel. Through both autonomous and declarative modes the Agent provides information to users enabling the teams to focus on more strategic efforts.

Autonomous Mode
The Agent will trigger when a message is added to a Microsoft Teams channel that is being monitored. If no reply is posted within 10 minutes by a member of the channel the Agent will search internal documentation and external Internet content for information. Answers are provided back to the posting user through an Adaptive Card as a reply to the original message.

Declaritive Mode
Users can interact directly with the Agent once it has been shared with the channel members. The same search logic leveraged in autonomous mode is used in declaritive mode.
